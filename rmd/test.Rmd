Experiment with the Rmd Code below and test output.

Inline Code highlighting with `mean(x)`. 

```{r calculate_mean, cache = TRUE}
n = 25
set.seed(42)
x = runif(n) # Generates 25 random numbers

mean(x)
```

If you do not want code to run just use:
```r
mean(x)
```

You can also embed a calculation within the text to show that `r mean(x)` is the mean
