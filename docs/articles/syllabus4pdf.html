<p>This course is intended to provide an introduction to statistical programming using the R language. It will also provide students with notions of data management, manipulation and analysis as well as of reproducible research, result-sharing and version control (using GitHub). At the end of the class, student should be able to construct the own R package, make it available on GitHub and document it using literate programming.</p>
<p>Tentative list of topics that will be discussed in this class are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Reproducible Research:</strong> <code>knitr</code> and <code>rmarkdown</code>;</li>
<li>
<strong>Version control:</strong> <code>Github</code>;</li>
<li>
<strong>Introduction to programming:</strong> Data structures, logical operators, control structures and functions;</li>
<li>
<strong>Visualizations:</strong> Exploratory data analysis with Base R and <code>ggplot2</code>;</li>
<li>
<strong>R packages:</strong> Construction of R-packages using <code>devtools</code>, <code>roxygen2</code>, <code>pkgdown</code>;</li>
<li>
<strong>Webscrapping:</strong> Automatic extraction of data from websites using <code>rvest</code> and <code>quantmod</code>;</li>
<li>
<strong>High performance computing:</strong> C++ (using <code>Rcpp</code>) and parallel computing.</li>

<p>Bring a laptop to class each day if you have one. I encourage students to work collaboratively, so I’d like to have at least one laptop for every 2 or 3 students. Please your laptop each week if you have one, but there’s no need to buy a laptop if you don’t already have one.</p>

<p>We will be using Piazza for class-related discussion and questions, to help you benefit from each other’s questions and the collective knowledge of your classmates and professor. Questions can be posted to the entire class (for content-related questions). I encourage you to ask questions if you are struggling to understand a concept, and to answer your classmates’ questions when you can.</p>
<p><strong>Do Not</strong> use Piazza for issues related to your grade or other private matters (not even an instructor post); email those questions or comments to the instructor directly or discuss them in person.</p>

<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#semester-project" class="anchor"></a>Semester Project</h3>
<p>The final project provides an opportunity to combine content learned throughout the course for use in some realistic application. All projects will be conducted in groups. The details of the semester will be discussed in class and students will have the opportunity to choose between several project formats.</p>
</div>
<div id="homeworks" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#homeworks" class="anchor"></a>Homeworks</h3>
<p>There will be <strong>four</strong> to <strong>six</strong> homework assignments this semester which will realized in groups. A tentative schedule will be communicated in the coming weeks.</p>
</div>
<div id="participation" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#participation" class="anchor"></a>Participation</h3>
<p>Participation is graded based on Piazza participation and in-class participation. In order to earn full credit for the Piazza portion, each student should make 1 or more substantive posts per week (except during the first week) related to the content of the course; <em>at least one post each week should be a reply to another student’s post</em>. Grading will utilize Piazza meta-data that can be accessed only by an instructor.</p>
</div>
<div id="attendance" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#attendance" class="anchor"></a>Attendance</h3>
<p>Due to the structure of this class, attendance is very important. Moreover, students will be encouraged to work in teams on in-class activities each week, so others are counting on you to be in class and contribute. Students with University excused absences (e.g. athletics) should notify the instructor as soon as possible and provide a minimum of one week notice.</p>
<p>Each lecture will have its own magic word that you are responsible for entering into a form link that will be provided on piazza. In order to be eligible to receive attendance points, you must be <em>in class</em>, enter the magic word within 5 minutes after it is given, and stay for entire duration of class. Periodically, checks will be performed to verify the attendance. Students who have entered the magic word but are not present, will fail class and will have an academic integrity violation opened against them. Please note, every student is eligible to miss <em>three</em> class periods without needing to provide a reason.</p>
<p>The exact method that we will use to calculate attendance at the end of the semester is given by:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">my_attendence =<span class="st"> </span>function(N, N_max){
    <span class="kw">round</span>( <span class="kw">min</span>( <span class="kw">c</span>( <span class="dv">1</span>, N/(N_max -<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">3</span>) ) )*<span class="dv">100</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>)
}</code></pre></div>
<p>where <code>N</code> denotes the number of times a student has attended class and <code>N_max</code> denotes the maximum number of classes where attendance was taken.</p>
</div>
<div id="late-work" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#late-work" class="anchor"></a>Late Work</h3>
<p>Late work is generally accepted for two days after the original due date (&amp; time) for 75% credit unless otherwise stated; assignments and projects submitted more than two days late (or not at all) are not accepted, and will be given a zero.</p>

<div id="academic-integrity-statement" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#academic-integrity-statement" class="anchor"></a>Academic Integrity Statement</h3>
<p>Academic dishonesty is not limited to simply cheating on an exam or assignment. The following is quoted directly from the “PSU Faculty Senate Policies for Students” regarding academic integrity and academic dishonesty: <em>Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity free from fraud and deception and is an educational objective of this institution. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarizing, fabricating of information or citations, facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others, having unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person or work previously used without informing the instructor, or tampering with the academic work of other students.</em></p>
<p>All University and Eberly College of Science policies regarding academic integrity/academic dishonesty apply to this course and the students enrolled in this course. Refer to the following URL for further details on the academic integrity policies of the Eberly College of Science: <a href="http://www.science.psu.edu/academic/Integrity/index.html" class="uri">http://www.science.psu.edu/academic/Integrity/index.html</a>. Each student in this course is expected to work entirely on her/his own while taking any exam, to complete assignments on her/his own effort without the assistance of others unless directed otherwise by the instructor, and to abide by University and Eberly College of Science policies about academic integrity and academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty can result in assignment of “F” by the course instructors or “XF” by Judicial Affairs as the final grade for the student.</p>
