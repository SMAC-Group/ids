Experiment with the Rmd Code below and test output.

* an asterisk starts an unordered list
* and this is another item in the list
+ or you can also use the + character
- or the - character

To start an ordered list, write this:

1. this starts a list *with* numbers
2. this will show as number '2.'
33. a wrong number here still shows as number '3.'
#. the '#' continues the list and shows as number '4.'
9. any number or '#' will keep the list going.
    * just indent by 4 spaces (or tab) to make a sub-list
        1. keep indenting for more sub lists
    * here i'm back to the second level

Use * or _ to emphasize things:

*this is in italic*  and _so is this_

**this is in bold**  and __so is this__

***this is bold and italic***  and ___so is this___

**Paragraph together (on one line):**

When I first brought my cat home from the humane society she was a mangy, pitiful animal. It cost a lot to adopt her: forty dollars. And then I had to buy litter, a litterbox, food, and dishes for her to eat out of. Two days after she came home with me she got taken to the pound by the animal warden. There's a leash law for cats in Fort Collins. If they're not in your yard they have to be on a leash. Anyway, my cat is my best friend. I'm glad I got her. She sleeps under the covers with me when it's cold. Sometimes she meows a lot in the middle of the night and wakes me up, though. (unfocused)

Inline Code highlighting with `mean(x)`. 

```{r calculate_mean, cache = TRUE}
n = 25
set.seed(42)
x = runif(n) # Generates 25 random numbers

mean(x)
```

If you do not want code to run just use:
```r
mean(x)
```

You can also embed a calculation within the text to show that `r mean(x)` is the meanWe will talk more about plots later, but here is an example of changing plot figure options.

```{r}
plot(1:10)
```
